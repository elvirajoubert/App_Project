          <h2><span class="primary-text">Who</span> We Are </h2>

          <p> Who doesnâ€™t love animals? The AppPrawject ACA team definitely does! We believe every animal deserves a
            home. To raise awareness for the protection and adoption of companion animals we have supported and
            volunteered at the Humane Society of Williamson County to help make a difference in homeless animals lives.
            Truth be told, even though I went to school for foreign languages, focusing on English and French studies,
            and specializing in learning those languages, I never really had the "dream" of spending 40-80 hours a week
            behind a desk. Given this, it should be no surprise that when I received a job offer as an interpreter for a
            Canadian medical/construction company right after my finals(final exams), I jumped at the opportunity. How
            exciting! As time went on, I continued to receive advanced training in management, synchronized
            interpretation,sales, inventory management, auditing, build-outs. This experience and training helped to
            develop a unique skill set, and a deep understanding of people from a wide range of backgrounds, as well as
            understanding and implementing effective business processes. After working as am Interpreter, CAD Designer,
            Operations Coordinator, Business Development for a few additional corporate and small companies, including
            assisting in the launch of an entirely new app, I felt it was time to put my skills to the test and build my
            own business. Thus, AppPrawject ACA was born.</p>

          <h2><span class="primary-text">What</span> We Do </h2>
          <p> Over the years since it's public launch, AppPrawject has continued to evolve and expand reach into new
            territories both physical and in range of services. Along with a new name and branding, V3.0 gave kennel and
            daycare facility operators access to our world-renowned software through the expansion into guest services.
            Despite the software only being available in English, we reached 12 countries in 2019, some of which don't
            even speak English. In 2019 we've done it again, releasing the Version 4.0, which is poised to become the
            single most popular pet service software on the planet. Who would have thought this brand would attain such
            reach!</p>
          <p> The amazing AppPrawject support team is a critical component, sitting on the front lines to help Pet Pros
            in need find solutions to their problems. They constantly help brainstorm new ideas and keep certain
            "reaching" ideas in check with their daily conversations with our Pet Pros out in the field. All of this
            comes together to influence the potential of the software as we continue into the future!</p>
